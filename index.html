                <article>
                    <h2>Early years</h2>
                    <p>Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, 
                        in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856.His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879),
                        was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.</p>

                    <h2>Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange</h2>
                    <p>Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, 
                        the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, 
                        so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, 
                        and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. 
                        During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, 
                        which was never patented nor publicly described.</p>

                    <h2>Working at Edison</h2>
                    <p>In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.[43] Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors.[44] They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany. </p>

                    <h2>Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing</h2>
                    <p>Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system,[63] possibly the same one he had developed at Edison.[48] In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents.[63] Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing.[64] Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey.[65] Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features. </p>

                    <h2>AC and the induction motor</h2>
                    <p>In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882).[71][72][73] This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.</p>

                    <h2>Tesla coil</h2>
                    <p>In the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz's 1886–1888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves.[101] Tesla found this new discovery "refreshing" and decided to explore it more fully. In repeating, and then expanding on, these experiments, Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his "oscillating transformer", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil.[102] Later called the Tesla coil, it would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity.[103] He would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work.</p>

                    <h2>X-ray experimentation</h2>
                    <p>Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments[131] (later identified as "Roentgen rays" or "X-Rays"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.</p>

                    <h2>Radio remote control</h2>
                    <p>In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed "telautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.[139] Tesla tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest.[140] Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs.[141] Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate "Teleautomatics" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899. </p>
